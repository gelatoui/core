# Responsive

This document provides an overview of recommended media queries for building responsive components using plain CSS. It outlines best practices and common breakpoints to ensure consistency across various devices.

## Recommended Breakpoints

A common approach is to use a mobile-first strategy. The table below lists some recommended breakpoints along with example media queries and descriptions.

| Device        | Breakpoint Range               | Media Query Example                                                                 | Description                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Mobile (XS)**   | Up to 575px                    | `@media (max-width: 575px) { ... }`                                                    | Styles for small mobile devices.                |
| **Tablet (SM)**   | 576px to 767px                 | `@media (min-width: 576px) and (max-width: 767px) { ... }`                             | Styles for larger mobiles or portrait tablets.  |
| **Tablet (MD)**   | 768px to 991px                 | `@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) { ... }`                             | Styles for tablets and small laptops.           |
| **Desktop (LG)**  | 992px to 1199px                | `@media (min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1199px) { ... }`                            | Styles for standard desktop displays.           |
| **Desktop (XL)**  | 1200px and up                  | `@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }`                                                   | Styles for large desktops and high-resolution screens. |

## Best Practices

- **Mobile-First Approach:**
  Start by designing for the smallest screens. Then, progressively enhance the layout as the screen size increases.

- **Consistency:**
  Use the same set of breakpoints across your project to maintain design uniformity.

- **Clear Ranges:**
  Define non-overlapping media query ranges to avoid conflicts and unexpected behavior.

- **Documentation:**
  Keep a centralized style guide or configuration file for breakpoints to ensure all team members are on the same page.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of how to use media queries in your CSS:

```css
/* Base styles for mobile-first design */
.container {
  padding: 16px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

/* Tablet styles */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    padding: 24px;
  }
}

/* Desktop styles */
@media (min-width: 992px) {
  .container {
    padding: 32px;
  }
}
```
